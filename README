Sonotopy: the mapping of sound (from Latin sonus for sound, topica for place)

Sonotopy is a C++ library for perceptually analyzing the contents of
an acoustic signal in real time. Its primary use is to map sound
streams such as music or voice to a visual or other kind of output.

The library consists of methods to extract high-level features from an
acoustic waveform. These numeric feature values can be interpreted as
e.g. shapes, colors or motion parameters. The library also gives
access to lower levels of processing such as spectral distribution.

Typical uses:
- visualization of music, beat-sensitive visuals
- dancing toys and robots
- artistic explorations of interactions between sound and other senses

Key features:
- implements a simple psychoacoustical model of the human hearing system,
  resulting in a "natural" response
- adaptivity: the underlying mechanisms constantly adapt to the
  current input, using biologically inspired algorithms (neural networks)
- efficient implementation in C++, supporting real-time processing
- high-level API: complex processing and large parameter sets are
  hidden behind simple abstractions
- cross-platform: the library compiles and runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
- noise robustness: the adaptivity and psychoacoustical modelling
  limits the effects of noise in the signal

The algorithms in the library are not intented to represent a true
model of the human auditory system. Instead, the main motivator behind
its development has been to explore artistic applications.

INSTALLATION

Sonotopy is built using Scons:
http://www.scons.org/

To compile, run "scons" in the root directory.

To install the library and header files, run "sudo scons install".
