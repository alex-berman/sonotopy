This is the Python bindings for the sonotopy library:

https://github.com/alex-berman/sonotopy

To install the Python library, first compile and install sonotopy as explained
in the sonotopy README and then:

python setup.py install

The bindings also need SWIG installed:

http://swig.org/

There is an example "dancer_kivy.py" in the "examples" directory, a port of the
"dancer" visualization of the C++ DemoBrowser example. It needs Kivy and the
Kivy audiostream extension:
